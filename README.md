# NeuralNetProjectFinal by Josias Moukpe 
Final neural net project


> Task is to solve the travelling salesman problem: the mininum value cycle going through all the cities on a map

## Run src/main.py to solve (approximately) TSP

> python3 src/main.py



# This project aimed at exploring the capabilities of a boltzmann machine to approximate a solution to the traveling salesman problem

> A sample output of the Network run is stored in docs/output.txt

> The paper used to make this neural network is docs/BoltzmannMachinesAndTeirApplications.pdf

> A screenshot of the best tour run was saved as docs/BestTourRunScreenshot.png
